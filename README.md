# Why this project?

Well this cannot be called a project is more of a dump of trying the Cobra tool in go.
The initil idea was to build a simple email format validator but over also used this to try some other stuff out.

## Things to try out

- [ ] Resize Image given image name (specific path)
- [x] Move file between paths given paths + filename
- [x] Move file between paths given filename
- [x] ~Email Format Validator~
- [x] ~Password Generator~

Some of the things in these points are applied in the test.go file and not has a command.

The image resize will be tested in a file called image.go

This can be considered a playground of mini projects to learn CLI Tools. (Chosed a bad starting command ðŸ‘Œ)
