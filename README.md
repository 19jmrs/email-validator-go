# Why this project?

Well this cannot be called a project is more of a dump of trying the Cobra tool in go.
The initil idea was to build a simple email format validator but over also used this to try some other stuff out.

## Things to try out

- [ ] Resize Image given image name (specific path)
- [ ] Move file between paths given paths + filename
- [ ] Move file between paths give filename
- [x] ~Email Format Validator~
- [x] ~Password Generator~

This can be considered a playground of mini projects to learn CLI Tools.
